This document contains information regarding the formatting of the layout.xml file.
(If the executable is ./runtrain, then the xml file should be ./data/layout.xml)

This file would probably not be considered a proper XML file.

There are four types of elements found within the document.

    <numSensors>  The number of sensors for the track.
    <numSections> The number of sections for the track.
    <numTurnouts> The number of turnouts for the track.
    <section>     An element describing a section.

There are 6 different Section Types, each indicated by an integer (0-5):

0 - Yard Termination

	The point at which the yard terminates.  Contains the sensors that lead to each section
	in the trainyard. (Which should in turn lead to the trainyard section.)

1 - Straight

	A straight rail. No turnouts. Two sensors.

	    =================

2 - Cross

	Two straight sections that intersect. Four sensors.
	When listing reservation numbers and sensor numbers, the order in which they should be
	provided is that in which opposites are paired together.

3 - Turnout

	A turnout. Two states, thrown/closed. Three sensors. May be linked to another turnout.
	When listing reservation numbers and sensor numbers, the order in which they should be
	provided is choke, closed, (i.e. the point in which all trains pass through) thrown.

4 - Trainyard

	The entrance/exit to a trainyard. Many turnouts linked together.
	When listing reservation numbers and sensor numbers, the order in which they should be
	provided is choke, thrown, thrown, ..., closed.


             //   //   //
		    //   //   //
           //   //   //
	    =================

5 - Turn Cross

	A section that has a turnout and a cross contained in it. Five sensors.
	When listing reservation numbers and sensor numbers, the order in which they should be
	provided is N/S, N/S, W, E, T. (See below for indications.)

		N          T

Inside the section element you will find a number of elements.

	<number>    Indicates the number corresponding to the section.
	<type>      Indicates the type (see above) of the section.
	<nextSect>  Defines the section (and sensor) pair leading from this section
				to another.
	<turnout>   (Optional) Defines information related to a turnout found in the section.
	<sectLink>  (Optional) Indicates if a section is linked to another (used for turnouts).

The nextSect element has subelements as follows:

	<id>       ID related to the order of the section (see above)
	<sensor>   Sensor that connects this section to the next.
	<sectNum>  Number corresponding to the next section.

The turnout element has subelements as follows:

	<id>   The ID for sorting turnouts when a section has more than one.
	<num>  The number corresponding to the turnout itself.
